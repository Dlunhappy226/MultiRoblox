# MultiRoblox
MultiRoblox allowed Roblox to be open in multiple instances at once.

I was inspired to make this after watching [SharkBlox's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUGn49Hjegc) on multi-instance launching.

## Installing
1. Download the [latest version of MultiRoblox](https://github.com/bloxstraplabs/bloxstrap/releases/latest).
2. Move the `MultiRoblox.exe` to [Windows' startup folder](https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000124550/how-to-add-app-to-startup-in-windows-10) or run it directly.
